# uorfs
Software to calculate the effect of a variant in a 5-prime UTR on the upstream open reading frames.

See https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/543504v2

This software will take a description of a variant, and calculate the set of uORFs in the reference and alternate alleles, then calculate the change in consequence. The software works on SNVs and InDels.
